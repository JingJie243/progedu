            HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create web pages and other types of documents intended for display in a web browser. Here are some key features and details of HTML:
            <ol>
                <li>Structure: HTML uses a hierarchical structure of nested elements to define the content and structure of a web page. The basic building block of HTML is the "tag", which is used to mark up content and provide structure to the page.</li>
                <li>Elements: HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are enclosed in angled brackets and consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some examples of HTML elements are headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.</li>
                <li>Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element. For example, the "img" element can have attributes like "src" (the URL of the image) and "alt" (a description of the image for accessibility purposes).</li>
                <li>Semantic markup: HTML has a variety of elements that are designed to provide semantic meaning to the content on the page. For example, the "header" element is used to define the header section of a page, while the "article" element is used to define an article or other self-contained piece of content.</li>
                <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS): CSS is a separate language used to describe the presentation and style of an HTML document. CSS can be used to define colors, fonts, layout, and other visual aspects of a web page.</li>

            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of web pages written in HTML and XHTML.
            <ol>
                <li>Separation of presentation and content: CSS allows the separation of the presentation of a document from its content. This makes it easier to maintain and update the visual appearance of a website, as changes can be made to the CSS file without altering the underlying HTML markup.</li>
                <li>Selectors: CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. There are a variety of selectors available, including tag selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and attribute selectors.</li>
                <li>Style properties: CSS allows developers to specify a wide range of style properties for HTML elements, such as font size, color, margin, padding, and border.</li>
                <li>Cascading and inheritance: CSS is designed to be cascading, which means that styles applied to an element can be inherited by its children. This makes it possible to create consistent styling across an entire website. In addition, when multiple styles are applied to an element, CSS uses a set of rules to determine which styles take precedence.</li>
                <li>Responsive design: CSS allows developers to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This can be achieved through techniques like media queries, which allow styles to be applied based on the size of the viewport.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>In 1991, a group of Sun Microsystems engineers led by James Gosling began work on a project called "Green" that was intended to develop a new programming language for use in consumer electronics devices.</li>
            <li>The Green team initially developed a language called Oak, but in 1995, Sun Microsystems officially released the language under the name Java.</li>
            <li>Java was designed to be platform-independent, meaning that it could be run on any system that had a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This made it ideal for use on the internet, as it could be used to create applets that could be run in a web browser.</li>
            <li>Java quickly became popular for internet programming, and in 1996, Sun Microsystems released the first version of the Java Development Kit (JDK).</li>

        <template>
            <ul>
            <li>In the late 1960s, Bell Labs was developing an operating system called Multics. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were two of the developers on the project, and they began to feel that the existing programming languages were not well-suited for systems programming.</li>
            <li>In 1972, Dennis Ritchie began work on a new programming language called C. C was designed to be a low-level language that was easy to write, compile, and debug, and could be used for systems programming.</li>
            <li>C quickly became popular, and in 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published "The C Programming Language", a book that served as a reference manual for the language.</li>
            <li>In the 1980s, C became widely used for system programming, especially in the Unix operating system. The language was also used for the development of early video games.</li>

            <li>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, began working on a language that would extend the C programming language with support for object-oriented programming.</li>
            <li>Stroustrup called the language "C with Classes", and it was designed to provide support for data abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.</li>
            <li>C++ quickly became popular, especially in the development of software systems that required high performance, such as operating systems and database management systems.</li>
            <li>Today, C++ is used in a wide range of applications, from operating systems and high-performance servers to video games and financial systems. It is also used as a foundation for other programming languages, such as Rust and Swift.</li>

            <ul>
            <li>In the late 1990s, Microsoft recognized a need for a new programming language that would be well-suited for developing Windows applications and web services.</li>
            <li>In 1999, a team of developers at Microsoft, led by Anders Hejlsberg, began work on a new language called "Cool" (C-like Object Oriented Language). Cool was designed to be a simple, modern, and type-safe language that could be used to build Windows applications.</li>
            <li>Cool was eventually renamed to C#, and the first version of the language was released in 2002 as part of the Microsoft .NET Framework.</li>
            <li>C# was designed to be similar to other popular programming languages, such as C++ and Java, but with additional features, such as support for garbage collection, properties, and delegates.</li>
            <li>Today, C# is used to build a wide range of applications, from desktop software to mobile apps and web services. It is also a popular language for game development, thanks to the Unity game engine, which uses C# as its primary scripting language.</li>

               <li>In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), was looking for a way to share information among scientists working on different projects.</li>
               <li>Berners-Lee created a system called "Enquire" that used hypertext to link documents together, but he realized that he needed a way to create and format documents that could be displayed on different computers and operating systems.</li>
               <li>In 1989, Berners-Lee created the first version of HTML, which included a small set of tags for formatting text and linking documents together.</li>
               <li> Today, HTML is one of the core technologies used to create web pages, along with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>In the early days of the web, HTML was used to define the structure and content of web pages, but there was no way to control the layout and appearance of the content.</li>
                <li>In 1994, a proposal for a style sheet language was put forward by Håkon Wium Lie, a researcher at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), and Bert Bos, who was working on the ViolaWWW web browser.</li>
                <li>CSS was first implemented in the Arena web browser, and was later added to other browsers, such as Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.</li>
                <li>Over the years, CSS was developed further, with new features being added to support more complex layouts and designs.</li>
                <li>Today, CSS is an essential part of web development, used to control the layout, typography, and appearance of web pages. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create rich, interactive web experiences.</li>

                <li>In 1995, Lerdorf released the source code for his scripts, which he called "Personal Home Page Tools" or "PHP Tools". The scripts were quickly adopted by other developers, who added new features and functionality.</li>
                <li>In 1998, the first version of the PHP language specification was published, and the first PHP conference was held in San Francisco.</li>
                <li>Today, PHP is used by millions of websites and is one of the most popular server-side scripting languages in use. It is often used in conjunction with databases and other web technologies to create dynamic, interactive web applications.</li>

                <li>The first public release of Ruby was in 1995, and the language quickly gained popularity in Japan.</li>
                <li>In 1998, an English version of the Ruby documentation was released, which helped to make the language more accessible to programmers outside of Japan.</li>
                <li>Over the next few years, Ruby continued to gain popularity, especially among web developers, who appreciated its flexibility and expressiveness.</li>
                <li>Today, Ruby is widely used for web development, as well as for a variety of other applications, such as data analysis and scientific computing. It is known for its elegant syntax, powerful metaprogramming capabilities, and its focus on developer happiness.</li>
